Hey, so this is the first time I've ever put anything github, so yeah... No idea what I'm doing.

I'm in the process of learning Lua. So, this is just a little mini-project/learning excercise I did. I just wanted to upload it to be able to share it online easily. It's not for anything, and it's kinda useless on it's own.

It's just a couple of Lua functions that will read from a table containing quest steps and info, progress through the steps, print out a message when a step is completed, and print out a message when the quest it completed that lists the rewards for completeing the quest.
