A collection of little learning excersises, I guess. Just random things I end up making while learning Lua (and maybe other languages, too.)

None of these will probably be useful for anything, really. I just wanted somewhere to put them online to make it easier to share them, and for posterity.

So, yeah... just little snippets of code I've cobbled together to sorta test myself on where my knowledge is.
